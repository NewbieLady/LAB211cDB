Does your earthquake map display earthquakes, cities and the key, as described through the end of step 9, as shown in this screenshot?|Yes
When you first ran the starter code for the programming assignment, why didn't it display any earthquake markers on the map?|The drawEarthquake method was not fully implemented in the OceanQuakeMarker and LandQuakeMarker classes.
Which of the following is/are true about the classes used in this programming assignment (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)?|The method colorDetermine, which is defined in the EarthquakeMarker class, is what determines the color of both OceanQuakeMarkers and LandQuakeMarkers.$EarthquakeMarker objects cannot be instantiated using "new".$The call 1 super(location); in the CityMarker's constructor calls the constructor of SimplePointMarker
Given the UML class hierarchy you created in step 6 of your programming assignment, which of the following assignment statements WILL NOT cause an error (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY). Assume all of the proper import statements are included at the top of the file.|1 2 // Assume the variable feature stores a PointFeature object EarthquakeMarker em = new OceanQuakeMarker(feature);$1 2 // Assume the variable loc stores a Location object Object o = new SimplePointMarker(loc);$1 SimplePointMarker m = new Marker();
Run your program using the file "quiz1.atom" as the input earthquakesURL. There is a line of code that you can uncomment in setUp that will do this, labeled "uncomment this line to take the quiz". How many earthquakes were reported in the United States of America?|74
Run your program using the file "quiz1.atom" as the input earthquakesURL. There is a line of code that you can uncomment in setup that will do this, labeled "uncomment this line to take the quiz". How many earthquakes were reported to have occurred in the ocean?|200
(REQUIRED) How long, total, did you spend on this programming assignment, to the nearest hour? Include only the time you were actively working on the programming assignment including time you spent watching support videos or re-watching videos specifically because you needed help on the assignment.|more than 5 hours.
