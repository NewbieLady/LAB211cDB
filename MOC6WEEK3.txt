Which of the following is a requirement for using the binary search algorithm to find an item in an array?|The array must be in sorted order
The following code implements binary search. Choose the option that correctly fills in the missing line of code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 /* Return true if toFind is found in toSearch, * otherwise return false. Uses binary search. */ public static boolean binarySeach(int[] toSearch, int toFind) { int low = 0; int high = toSearch.length - 1; int mid; while ( << INSERT ANSWER CODE HERE >> ) { mid = low + ((high-low)/2); if (toFind < toSearch[mid]) { high = mid-1; } else if (toFind > toSearch[mid]) { low = mid+1; } else return true; } return false; }|1 high >= low
Consider the following ordering of integers in an array: 8 , 12 , 45 , 58 , 22 , 18 , 43 , 30 Which of the following sorting algorithms could have produced this array above after 3 iterations of its outer loop?|Insertion Sort
True or false: Selection sort is faster when the elements in the array are already sorted than when they are unsorted.|False
True or false: Insertion sort as we examined in (i.e. mystery sort) is faster when the elements in the array are already sorted than when they are unsorted.|True
Which of the following correctly implements the compareTo method in EarthquakeMarker so that earthquakes are sorted from highest magnitude to lowest magnitude?|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public int compareTo(EarthquakeMarker m) { if (m.getMagnitude() < this.getMagnitude()) return -1; else if (this.getMagnitude() < m.getMagnitude()) return 1; else return 0; }
Run your program with the earthquake input file "quiz2.atom". There is a commented out line of code in the setUp method in EarthquakeCityMap that you can uncomment to make this happen: 1 earthquakesURL = "quiz2.atom"; Call sortAndPrint as appropriate to answer the following question. What is the magnitude of the 6th earthquake printed (i.e. the 6th strongest earthquake)? To be clear, if there are two earthquakes of the same magnitude, each magnitude will count. For example, if the top 4 magnitudes are {7, 6.9, 6.9, and 6}, the 4th largest is 6.|6.4
Run your program with the earthquake input file "quiz2.atom". There is a commented out line of code in the setUp method in EarthquakeCityMap that you can uncomment to make this happen: 1 earthquakesURL = "quiz2.atom"; Call sortAndPrint as appropriate to answer the following question. What is the strongest magnitude that is repeated three or more times in the data set?|5.9
In the programming assignment, we asked you to notice and reflect on at least one difference between your code for module 5 and our starter code for module 6 (i.e. our solutions for module 5). Describe that difference and what you noticed about it here. Which solution did you like better, or were they just different?|i think they are different with me
