Does your program correctly respond to mouse clicks and mouse hovers, as described in the project assignment write up? This should include the following behaviors (test them now): When I city or earthquake is hovered over, information should be displayed about that city or earthquake. Test this by hovering over several cities and earthquakes now. It should never be the case that information for more than one item is displayed at the same time. Test this last point explicitly by hovering over two nearby cities or earthquakes, and a city next to an earthquake. If all earthquakes and cities are displayed, when you click on an earthquake, all other earthquakes should be hidden and all cities except those in the threat circle should be hidden. Test this by clicking on an earthquake now. If earthquakes or cities are hidden, clicking anywhere should re-display all earthquake and city markers. Test this by clicking somewhere now. Try to test clicking on where a hidden earthquake is to make sure it's not selected. If all earthquakes and cities are displayed, when you click on a city, all other cities should be hidden and all earthquakes except those that affect the city (city is in their threat circle) should be hidden. Test this by clicking on a city that has some nearby earthquakes now. If you click on no marker and everything is already displayed, nothing should happen. Test this now.|Yes
Select the classes that are the direct subclasses of (i.e. directly extend) the class CommonMarker in module 5 programming assignment (when the assignment is complete). Select ALL that apply.|CityMarker$EarthquakeMarker
What caused the bug in the starter code when you modified CityMarker to extend CommonMarker instead of SimplePointMarker?|CityMarker did not implement the drawMarker method, which is abstract in CommonMarker.
What common functionality does CommonMarker implement for its subclasses? In other words, what functionality is inherited by subclasses (not overrided) and used either by users of subclass objects or by the subclass itself? Select ALL that apply.|The setClicked method that allows the user to set the "clicked" state of the marker.$The draw method
Where are the variables mouseX and mouseY, which you used in the method selectMarkerIfHover, declared?|They are member variables of the PApplet class and are inherited by EarthquakeCityMap
In which class(es) is the code that actually draws the text label (i.e. the call to the PGraphics text(...) method) next to the city markers and earthquake markers located? Select ALL that apply.|EarthquakeMarker$CityMarker
Consider the following code, which might be used as a helper method in the mouseClicked method for this programming assignment. This method is supposed to do the following: If lastClicked is not null, it should abort the method. Otherwise it should check all of the cities for a click. If it finds a city that has been clicked and that city is not hidden and that city is the first one it finds to be clicked, it sets lastClicked to be that city's marker It then sets the rest of the cities to be hidden. If there is no city clicked, it does nothing to the city markers. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 private void checkCitiesForClick() { if (lastClicked != null) return; for (Marker marker : cityMarkers) { if (!marker.isHidden() && marker.isInside(map, mouseX, mouseY) && lastClicked == null) { lastClicked = (CommonMarker)marker; } else { marker.setHidden(true); } } } Does this code have a bug, and if so, what is it?|If no city is clicked, this code will hide all the cities (instead of leaving them alone like it is supposed to).
In precise English, describe how your code handles and responds to mouse clicks. You should not include code in your description. You should include a short description (a couple sentences) for what each method does, as well as the overall flow of how the methods work together. Being able to describe technical code using English in a way a technical person who is unfamiliar with your code can understand is an important skill. So while this is an ungraded question, we encourage you to try it. We've included our explanation (of our code) so you can have a reference for what we are looking for after you attempt your own explanation. We'll ask you do to similar explanations in the peer review assignment at the end of module 6 as well as in future courses.|yes bring it to me and i will answer at modul 6
How long, total, did you spend on this programming assignment, to the nearest hour? Include only the time you were actively working on the programming assignment including time you spent watching support videos or re-watching videos specifically because you needed help on the assignment.|i think i spend a lot of time for this before so now i just spend more than 5 hours to finish
