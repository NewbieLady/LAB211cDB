Consider writing code to list out files in one of your folders using DirectoryResource. The following attempt at writing such code has an error. Which one of the following best explains what the error is?|The dr that is highlighted should be dir.
Shown below is the code that was developed in one of the videos to convert many images to grayscale and to display those grayscale images. Consider adding additional code to this program to save each of the new grayscale images created as a file. Which one of the following is the best method to modify to make this change?|Modify the selectAndConvert method.
Suppose one wants to convert a given image to grayscale and then display and save the resulting grayscale image as a file. The code below has been started for you. The variable f is a file of an image and the method makeGray returns an image that is the grayscale image of the original image. 1 2 3 ImageResource original = new ImageResource(f); ImageResource grayscale = makeGray(original); [MISSING CODE] Which one of the following is the missing code that will convert the original image into a new file that is a grayscale version of the original image?|1 2 3 4 5 String fname = original.getFileName(); String newName = "grayscale-" + fname; grayscale.setFileName(newName); grayscale.draw(); grayscale.save();
Consider writing a program to create new images that are photographic negatives (or inverted images) of selected images. In inverting an image, a pixel's red, blue and green components are modified to be the exact opposite within the 0 to 255 range. That is, if a pixel's red, blue, and green values are (34, 198, 240) then that same pixel in the inverted image would have the red, blue, and green values of (221, 57, 15). Note that 255 - 34 is 221, 255 - 198 is 57, and 255 - 240 is 15. For example, these images show the original and inverse images of Robert. Suppose a pixel has RGB values of (100, 30, 250). Which one of the following shows the correct RGB values for the inverted pixel?|The RGB values would be (155, 225, 5).
Consider writing a program to create new images that are photographic negatives (or inverted images) of selected images. Suppose we have a Pixel named pxInvert and a Pixel named pxOriginal. What is the line of code to change pxInvert's red color to the inverted red color of pxOriginal? Hints: Start with pxInvert.setRed Remember the semi colon at the end.|pxInvert.setRed(255-pxOriginal.getRed());
Consider writing a program to create new images that are photographic negatives (or inverted images) of selected images. Suppose we have an ImageResource variable named picture whose current value is for an image file named dragon.png. See the following code segment below. 1 2 3 4 5 ImageResource invertImage = makeInverted(picture); String fname = picture.getFileName(); invertImage.setFileName("inv-" + fname); invertImage.draw(); invertImage.save(); What is the name of the resulting file?|inv-dragon.png
