Consider the following code for the function mysteryShape that has one parameter a Shape s and calls the function getNumPoints from the assignment. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 public double mysteryShape (Shape s) { double tmp = 0; for (Point p : s.getPoints()) { if (p.getX() > 0) { if (p.getY() < 0) { tmp = tmp + 1; } } } return tmp / getNumPoints(s); } Which one of the following best describes the purpose of this function?|The function computes the percentage of those points from the Shape s that have a positive X and a negative Y.
